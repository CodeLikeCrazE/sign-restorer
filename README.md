# Sign Restorer Fabric Mod
Easily replace signs in game using saved data from other programs.
Sign data is read from the .minecraft folder from signdata.json in the format:
`{"0 50 0":{"text":["Line 1","","",""],"flags":{}},"0 51 0":{"text":["","","","Line 4"],"flags":{}}}`
Type `&reloadsigns` in game chat to reload the sign data from the json file.
